<ol>
<li>Research / internship / something interesting to do over the summer.</li>
<li>At-home quantum experiments. Probably begin with some of Prutchi’s experiments from his book. Also look at the MIT paper for creating single photon sources with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and household bleach.</li>
<li>Create an auto-focus system for the Raman spectroscopy lab. That can probably be its own post as some work has already gone into that.</li>
<li>Deal with existential crisis. Went into studying physics to learn how the universe works. Now find myself far more fascinated with applying the fundamental principles that I am learning.</li>
<li>Finances and taxes. Rental property needs focus. Arg! Not as fun as physics and electronics.</li>
