          <p>Finally! I’ve been trying to get this experiment to work for a while but I the signal was always too weak. In class with Dr. Podzorov, we learned about op-amps so I figured I’d give it a shot to finally get this experiment working. It worked!</p>
<p>In David and Shanni Prutchi’s book Exploring Quantum Physics Through Hands-On Projects, one of the first experiments they describe is a way to automatically scan the interference pattern produced by something like a laser shining through a double-slit. This seems like a great idea since putting a ruler against the screen to measure tiny separations in fringes is a pain in the ass.</p>
<p><img src="laser-mirror.jpeg" alt="Laser and Mirror Setup"></p>
<p>The laser shining through the double-slit onto the rotating mirror. You can see the diffraction pattern behind the mirror. This shows up because every time the mirror rotates part of it hits the wall behind.</p>
<p>The idea is that they use a fast rotating mirror to reflect the interference pattern toward a photo diode, which has a small window to block everything but the intensity at every fraction of a moment, which allows it to sense only the intensity of a small portion of the interference pattern as the mirror rotates.</p>
<p>Here’s a video showing when I finally got it to work: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BEgxtvaL_QI">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BEgxtvaL_QI</a></p>
<p>Anyway, I wont’ go through all of the details, the setup is described in the book. The biggest differences between what I did and the book is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I used a regular silicon photo-diode with an op-amp circuit to boost the signal rather than using the TAOS light to voltage converter;</li>
<li>My mirror was rotating at roughly 800 RPM rather than 4-8,000;</li>
<li>The slit that covers the photo-diode was not small, in fact it was nearly the size of the photo-diode itself. I’m not totally sure why this worked for me – I think it had to do with the RPM of the mirror.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some pictures of the experimental setup and the results.</p>
<p><img src="opamp-circuit.jpeg" alt="Opamp Circuit"></p>
<p>This is the op-amp circuit, you can see the diode and just barely see the two razor blades at the bottom of the breadboard.</p>

<p>View from the other side of the razor blades.</p>
<p><img src="laser-mirror.jpeg" alt="Laser and Mirror Setup"></p>
<p>The laser (650nm) connected to a 9V battery (under breadboard) through a voltage regulator circuit. On the right is the diffraction mosaic. I used the double slit for this experiment (~0.3mm slit separation).</p>
<p><img src="laser-slits2.jpeg" alt="Laser and Slits"></p>
<p>The scope showing the interference pattern (inverted due to the op-amp circuit).</p>
<p><img src="motor-mirror.jpeg" alt="Motor Mirror Setup"></p>
<p>The motor-mirror setup. This is a 25.9V motor that I ran with a 9V battery. I used the oscilloscope to measure the RPM at 9V and found it to be ~800. The mirror is from an old camera that I took apart and the motor came from some random junk appliance, can’t remember what it was.</p>
<p><img src="scope.jpeg" alt="Scope"></p>
<p>Image of scope screen when the experiment is running with the lights off.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s it for now. I plan to do this again with a proper light to voltage converter and some other adaptations to smooth out the signal. I’ll also probably make the setup a bit more durable and try some other wavelengths of light.</p>
