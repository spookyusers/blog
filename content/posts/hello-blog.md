For now this is intended to be my second brain. Bring together the scattered notes from notebooks, post-its, book margins, the cloud, local files, wherever. Also kind of an open journal. Things that, while they may be personal, like most things I don’t mind them being publicly visible.

So a little bit of a status brain dump to begin. We’ve got a few things going on actively or tumbling around the back of the brain.

1. Research / internship / something interesting to do over the summer.
2. At-home quantum experiments. Probably begin with some of Prutchi’s experiments from his book. Also look at the MIT paper for creating single photon sources with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and household bleach.
3. Create an auto-focus system for the Raman spectroscopy lab. That can probably be its own post as some work has already gone into that.
4. Deal with existential crisis. Went into studying physics to learn how the universe works. Now find myself far more fascinated with applying the fundamental principles that I am learning.
5. Finances and taxes. Rental property needs focus. Arg! Not as fun as physics and electronics.
